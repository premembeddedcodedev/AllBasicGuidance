TUI Enablement to see source code browsing in two windows like tmux:

      When you are stepping with n in GDB tui mode, source code window can get broken. 
      This can happen when the program is printing something to stdout, breaking layout of tui windows.
      Looks like this is what happening in 911 line in DPRINTF() call. To fix the layout you can press Ctrl+L and tui window will be refreshed.
